# Feather
An experimental ghost theme built on React

This project is in quite an early stage. It is being developed to be a standalone client side app like theme to provide
faster user experience. React has been in rage now for some time; and hence choosing the same for the project. The idea
is to complete the whole project incrementally.  
- [x] Step I - Installing basic project dependencies.
- [x] Step II - Start building client side views
- [x] Step III - Integrate [ghost.url.api()](https://themes.ghost.org/docs/ghost-url-api) to fetch and render data
- [ ] Step IV - Try server rendering, and send down app state to hook client side.
